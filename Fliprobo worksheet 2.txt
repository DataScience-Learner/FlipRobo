Q12: Yes, K-means is sensitive to outliers, for the same reason a box plot is not able to give the full  picture of the distribution, as it takes the mean; it is highly sensitive to very big or very small values.

Q13: K-means can handle big data and it always converges.

Q14: No, K-means is not deterministic; as it selects a random seed for initial value; and depending on initial value the alrorithm may give different results. it also has to be noted if the same seed is selected then the result is repeatable, but if not; K-means is a non detemernistic algorithm.
